# Quickstart Guide

Here's how to get it up and running quickly.

## Setup

1. The first step is to download and install [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

3. If you want to run the examples, skip to step 7.

4. Create or open existing Unreal Engine project.

5. Setup `AccelByteUe4Sdk` first before custom extension plugin. 

6. Copy the custom extension plugin folder `Plugins/AccelByteUe4SdkCustomization` to your game's plugins folder after AccelByteUe4Sdk setup. 

7. Add the plugins to your `/MyAwesomeGame.uproject` file,
```java
"Plugins": [

    "Enabled": true
},
{
    "Name": "AccelByteUe4SdkCustomization",
    "Enabled": true
},
...
```
in `/Source/MyAwesomeGame.Target.cs`, and in `/Source/MyAwesomeGameEditor.Target.cs`.
```cs
ExtraModuleNames.AddRange(new string[]
{
    ...
    "AccelByteUe4Sdk",
    "AccelByteUe4SdkCustomization",
    ...
}
```
also in `/Source/MyAwesomeGame/MyAwesomeGame.Build.cs`.
```cs
 PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(
			new string[] {
				...
                "AccelByteUe4Sdk",
                "AccelByteUe4SdkCustomization",
